# Installation

This Dash App works best with an older version of Python, specifically `Python 3.10.11 - April 5, 2023`

Do the following to install an older version of Python without messing up your existing environment.

1. Download and install to `C:\Python310`, but do NOT associate this version with .py files and DO NOT add to PATH.
2. Navigate to `C:\repos\cohen`
3. Create new venv using `C:\Python310\python.exe -m venv venv_cohen`
4. Verify Python version using `python --version`
5. Install requirements using `python -m pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`
